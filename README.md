# TIMS-NG
A distributed data base for tracking Red Cross DST equipment deployed on DROs.
This is a re-write of TIMS using [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) to provide a distributed DB that has all of the functionality of the current TIMS plus additional features inherent in a modern distributed DB.
Contributors are welcome from anywhere but experienced Red Cross DST volunteers will probably be most comfortable working on this project.
Actual Red Cross equipment data will NOT be used in this public project but example data will be provided to facilitate testing and development.  Screen shots will probably be provided of the current version of TIMS in order to illustrate the structure to build upon.
